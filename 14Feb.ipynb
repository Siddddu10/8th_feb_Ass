    "'''Q1) What is multithreading in python?Why is it used? Name the module used to handle\n",
    "threads in python\n",
    "Ans-1)Multithreading is a programming technique that allows a program to perform multiple \n",
    "tasks concurrently within a single process. In Python, multithreading can be achieved using\n",
    "the threading module.\n",
    "2)Multithreading in Python is used to improve the performance of programs by allowing them \n",
    "to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, making better use of system resources such as CPU\n",
    "and memory. It can also be used to create responsive user interfaces, where long-running \n",
    "tasks are executed in the background, while the main thread handles user input and displays\n",
    "updates.\n",
    "3)To handle threads in Python, the threading module is used. This module provides a simple \n",
    "way to create and manage threads, with methods for starting and stopping threads, waiting \n",
    "for them to finish, and synchronizing their execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q2)Why threading module used? Write the use of the following functions\n",
    " 1)activeCount()\n",
    " 2)currentThread()\n",
    " 3)enumerate()\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-The threading module in Python is used to implement multithreading in Python programs. \n",
    "Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently within a single \n",
    "process, which can improve program performance by utilizing system resources such as CPU\n",
    "and memory more efficiently.\n",
    "1)activeCount() is a method provided by the threading module in Python that returns the \n",
    "number of Thread objects that are currently active in the current Python interpreter.\n",
    "An active thread is a thread that has been started and has not yet finished executing or \n",
    "terminated.\n",
    "2)currentThread() is a method provided by the threading module in Python that returns the\n",
    "Thread object representing the current thread of execution. This method can be called from\n",
    "within any thread to obtain a reference to the Thread object that represents that thread.\n",
    "3)enumerate() is a built-in function in Python that can be used to iterate over a sequence\n",
    "of elements while keeping track of the element's index. The function takes an iterable as\n",
    "its argument and returns an iterator that generates pairs consisting of the index and the \n",
    "corresponding element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3)Explain the following functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- 1)In Python, run() is a method provided by the Thread class in the threading module. This\n",
    "method is used to start a new thread of execution by calling the run() method of the target\n",
    "function or method provided when the Thread object was created.\n",
    "2)In Python, start() is a method provided by the Thread class in the threading module. \n",
    "This method is used to start a new thread of execution by creating a new system thread and \n",
    "alling the run() method of the target function or method provided when the Thread object was\n",
    "created.\n",
    "3)In Python, join() is a method provided by the Thread class in the threading module. \n",
    "This method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution and return before \n",
    "continuing with the rest of the program.\n",
    "4)In Python, isAlive() is a method provided by the Thread class in the threading module.\n",
    "This method is used to check whether a thread is currently executing or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5)State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Performance: Multithreading allows the execution of multiple threads concurrently,\n",
    "which can lead to improved performance and better utilization of available resources such as\n",
    "CPU and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster Response Time: By allowing multiple threads to execute concurrently, multithreading\n",
    "can reduce the response time of an application, which is particularly important in real-time\n",
    "systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better Resource Management: Multithreading enables efficient use of system resources, such \n",
    "as memory and I/O devices, by allowing multiple threads to share these resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced User Experience: Multithreading can improve the user experience of an application\n",
    "by enabling it to perform background tasks while the user interacts with the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easier Code Maintenance: By dividing a complex task into smaller, more manageable threads,\n",
    "multithreading can make code easier to maintain and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Complexity: Multithreading introduces additional complexity into an application,\n",
    "which can make it more difficult to develop and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Overhead: Creating and managing multiple threads can result in increased overhead\n",
    ", which can reduce performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization Issues: When multiple threads share resources, such as memory, there can be\n",
    "synchronization issues that must be carefully managed to avoid data corruption and other\n",
    "problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficulty in Debugging: Debugging multithreaded applications can be difficult, especially\n",
    "when there are synchronization issues or race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread Safety: Developers must ensure that their code is thread-safe, which can require \n",
    "additional effort and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6)Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
