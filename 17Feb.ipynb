    "'''Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is\n",
    "preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-1)MongoDB is a document-oriented, NoSQL database that uses JSON-like documents with optional\n",
    "schemas. It is designed to store and manage unstructured data and allows for highly flexible \n",
    "and scalable data modeling. MongoDB is open source and has a large and active community of \n",
    "developers and users.\n",
    "2)Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional \n",
    "tabular, relational data model of SQL databases. Instead, NoSQL databases use various data \n",
    "models such as document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph databases. They are \n",
    "designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and offer high \n",
    "scalability and performance.\n",
    "3)MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for:Flexible data\n",
    "modeling: MongoDB's document-based data model allows for a flexible schema that can easily \n",
    "accommodate changes in data structures and relationships without requiring a database schema \n",
    "update.\n",
    "High scalability and performance: MongoDB uses horizontal scaling, which allows it to handle \n",
    "large volumes of data by adding more servers to a cluster. It also provides fast read and write\n",
    "operations.\n",
    "Unstructured or semi-structured data: MongoDB is designed to handle unstructured data such as\n",
    "documents, images, videos, and social media data.\n",
    "Real-time data processing: MongoDB supports real-time data processing, making it suitable for\n",
    "use cases that require real-time analytics and processing, such as online gaming, e-commerce, \n",
    "and IoT.\n",
    "Cloud-based applications: MongoDB is well-suited for cloud-based applications as it can be \n",
    "easily deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that has a number of features that \n",
    "make it a popular choice for developers and enterprises. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "1)Document data model: MongoDB uses a document data model, where data is stored in flexible, JSON-like\n",
    "documents that can have varying structures and fields. This allows for easy and flexible data \n",
    "modeling and supports nested and hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "2)Dynamic schema: MongoDB has a dynamic schema, which means that documents in a collection do not \n",
    "have to have the same fields or structure. This allows for easy and flexible data modeling and \n",
    "supports nested and hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "3)High availability: MongoDB supports automatic replication and failover, which means that it can\n",
    "maintain multiple copies of data across multiple nodes in a cluster. If one node fails, another\n",
    "node can take over automatically without any disruption to the application.\n",
    "4)Horizontal scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling, which allows it to handle large \n",
    "amounts of data by adding more nodes to a cluster. This makes it easy to scale up and down as \n",
    "needed.\n",
    "5)Rich query language: MongoDB provides a rich query language that supports a wide range of\n",
    "operations, including queries, updates, and aggregation. It also supports full-text search and \n",
    "geospatial queries.\n",
    "6)Indexing: MongoDB supports a wide range of indexing options, including single field, compound,\n",
    "multikey, and geospatial indexes. This makes it easy to optimize queries and improve performance.\n",
    "7)Native aggregation: MongoDB provides native support for aggregation, which allows for complex \n",
    "data analysis and processing. This can help improve performance and reduce data processing times.\n",
    "8)GridFS: MongoDB provides GridFS, a specification for storing and retrieving large files, such \n",
    "as images, videos, and audio files. This allows for efficient and scalable storage of large \n",
    "files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3.Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-import pymongo\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "collection = db['mycollection']\n",

    "result = collection.insert_one(post)\n",
    "print(\"Inserted post with ID: {}\".format(result.inserted_id))\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record,\n",
    "and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",

    "Q5.Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code\n",
    "to demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-The find() method is used to query the MongoDB database and retrieve data from a collection.\n",
    "It takes an optional filter object as an argument to specify the criteria for matching documents.\n",
    "The filter object can contain key-value pairs that define the fields and values to match.\n",
    "Here's an example code that demonstrates how to use the find() method to query a MongoDB database:\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establishing a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a database\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a collection\n",
    "collection = db['mycollection']\n",

    "# Inserting some data into the collection\n",

    "# Querying the collection using the find() method\n",
    "result = collection.find({\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing the results\n",
    "for doc in result:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-The sort() method in MongoDB is used to sort the results of a query in ascending or\n",
    "descending order based on one or more fields. The sort() method takes a dictionary as an\n",
    "argument, where each key represents a field to sort by and the corresponding value is either 1\n",
    "for ascending order or -1 for descending order.\n",
    "Here's an example code that demonstrates sorting in MongoDB using the sort() method:\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establishing a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "Q7.Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-In MongoDB, there are different methods available to delete documents or collections from a\n",
    "database. These methods are delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop().\n",
    "\n",
    "delete_one() method is used to delete a single document that matches the specified filter criteria. If multiple documents match the filter criteria, only the first one will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "delete_many() method is used to delete all documents that match the specified filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "drop() method is used to drop a collection from the database. Dropping a collection means removing all the documents from the collection and deleting the collection itself.\n",
