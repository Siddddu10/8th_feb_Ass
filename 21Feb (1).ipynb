    "'''Q1-What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Web scraping is the automated process of extracting information or data from websites.\n",
    "It involves using software or code to scrape the HTML pages of a website and extract data,\n",
    "which can then be saved and analyzed for various purposes.\n",
    "Web scraping is used for various reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection: Web scraping is a fast and efficient way to collect data from a large number\n",
    "of websites. This can be useful for market research, competitive analysis, lead generation, and\n",
    "more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis: Once the data has been collected, web scraping tools can be used to analyze and\n",
    "visualize the data, helping businesses make more informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation: Web scraping can automate many tasks that would otherwise be done manually, such as\n",
    "monitoring prices, tracking social media activity, and gathering information about competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three areas where web scraping is commonly used to get data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce: Web scraping is often used in the e-commerce industry to gather data about prices,\n",
    "product details, and customer reviews. This data can help businesses stay competitive and make \n",
    "informed pricing and marketing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research: Web scraping can be used by researchers to collect data for academic papers, studies,\n",
    "and surveys. This data can be used to analyze trends and patterns in various industries and \n",
    "fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media: Web scraping tools can be used to extract data from social media platforms, such\n",
    "as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. This data can be used to track brand mentions, analyze \n",
    "customer sentiment, and gather insights for social media marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-There are several methods used for web scraping, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing HTML: This method involves using HTML parsing libraries like Beautiful Soup or lxml to \n",
    "extract data from the HTML code of a web page. The libraries can be used to search for specific\n",
    "HTML tags, attributes, and content, and then extract the relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using APIs: Many websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow \n",
    "developers to extract data in a structured way. This method is more reliable and efficient than\n",
    "parsing HTML, as the data is already structured and can be retrieved in a standardized format,\n",
    "such as JSON or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated web browsers: This method involves using automated web browsers, such as Selenium or \n",
    "Puppeteer, to interact with web pages as a user would. The tool can be used to simulate user \n",
    "actions like clicking links, filling out forms, and scrolling pages, and then extract the \n",
    "relevant data from the resulting HTML code.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP Requests: This method involves sending HTTP requests directly to the server and then \n",
    "parsing the response HTML code. This can be done using libraries like Requests or urllib in \n",
    "Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping services: There are also web scraping services that allow businesses to outsource \n",
    "their web scraping needs to third-party providers. These services typically use a combination \n",
    "of the methods above to extract data in a scalable and efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3.What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Beautiful Soup is a popular Python library used for web scraping. It provides a set of\n",
    "tools for parsing HTML and XML documents and extracting data from them.\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is used for web scraping because it provides an easy-to-use API for parsing HTML\n",
    "and XML documents, and it can handle imperfect HTML code that might not be well-formed or\n",
    "standards-compliant. It can navigate the DOM (Document Object Model) of a webpage and search \n",
    "for specific elements and attributes, and it can extract the content and text within those \n",
    "elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup can also be used in combination with other Python libraries, such as Requests \n",
    "for making HTTP requests to web pages, and Pandas for organizing and analyzing the extracted \n",
    "data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Why is flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Flask is a popular web framework used for building web applications in Python. Flask is \n",
    "lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, making it a great choice for building web applications \n",
    "that involve web scraping.\n",
    "Flask can be used in web scraping projects for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping projects often involve creating a web application to display the scraped data. \n",
    "Flask makes it easy to create a web application with minimal boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask provides a simple and easy-to-use API for handling HTTP requests and responses. This is \n",
    "useful for creating a web scraper that can take input from a user and return the scraped data in\n",
    "a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask provides a built-in templating engine that makes it easy to create dynamic HTML pages.\n",
    "This can be useful for displaying the scraped data in a visually appealing and organized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask can be easily extended with third-party libraries and plugins. This makes it easy to add\n",
    "functionality to a web scraper, such as caching, authentication, and database integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- \n",
