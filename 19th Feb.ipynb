    "'''Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Flask is a micro web framework written in Python that allows developers to quickly build \n",
    "web applications with minimal setup and boilerplate code. It is a lightweight framework that is\n",
    "easy to learn and has a low barrier to entry, making it a popular choice for small to medium-sized\n",
    "web applications and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework that does not require many dependencies or\n",
    "additional libraries to get started. This makes it easy to learn and use, especially for\n",
    "beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to use: Flask has a simple and intuitive API that is easy to use. It provides a wide range\n",
    "of built-in tools and utilities that simplify common web development tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask provides developers with a lot of flexibility and freedom when it comes to \n",
    "designing and structuring their applications. It allows developers to choose their own database,\n",
    "templating engine, and other components, giving them complete control over their application \n",
    "stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Flask is highly extensible and allows developers to easily integrate with other \n",
    "Python libraries and frameworks. This makes it easy to add new features and functionality to\n",
    "your application as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: Flask provides built-in support for testing, making it easy to write and execute unit\n",
    "tests and integration tests for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Flask is scalable and can be used to build applications of any size, from small\n",
    "prototypes to large-scale web applications. It also supports multiple concurrent requests, \n",
    "making it ideal for building web APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’. Attach the screenshot of the \n",
    "output in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    return 'Hello World!!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-App routing is a feature in Flask that allows developers to map URLs to specific Python \n",
    "functions, also known as view functions. In other words, app routing is the mechanism that \n",
    "Flask uses to determine what code should be executed when a user requests a specific URL\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask to define the structure of our web application and to determine how \n",
    "users will navigate through it. By defining different routes for different pages, we can make \n",
    "our application more organized and easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''Q4. Create a “/welcome” route to display the welcome message “Welcome to ABC Corporation” and a\n",
    "“/”route to show the following details:\n",
    "Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "Location: India\n",
    "Contact Detail: 999-999-9999\n",
    "Attach the screenshot of the output in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "'''Q5. What function is used in Flask for URL Building? Write a Python code to demonstrate the\n",
    "working of the url_for() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-In Flask, the url_for() function is used for URL building. It takes the name of a view\n",
    "function as its first argument, and any additional keyword arguments as parameters to generate \n",
    "a URL that maps to that function.\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "from flask import Flask, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
