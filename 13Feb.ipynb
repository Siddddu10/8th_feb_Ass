    "'''Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-In object-oriented programming, an exception is a way to handle and indicate errors and \n",
    "abnormal conditions that may occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "When a program encounters an error, it can throw an exception that contains information about \n",
    "the error and its context. By catching and handling these exceptions, we can gracefully handle \n",
    "errors and prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "To create a custom exception in python, we need to create a new class that extends the Exception\n",
    "class or one of its subclasses. The reason we extend the Exception class is that it provides a \n",
    "standardized way to handle and propagate exceptions.\n",
    "By extending the Exception class, our custom exception class inherits all the methods and \n",
    "properties of the Exception class, including the ability to set and retrieve the exception \n",
    "message, stack trace, and other relevant information.\n",
    "Furthermore, extending the Exception class ensures that our custom exception is compatible\n",
    "with other exception handling mechanisms, such as the try-catch block and the throws keyword, \n",
    "making it easier to integrate our custom exception into our codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Write a python program to print Python Exception Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-def print_exception_hierarchy(exception_class, indent=0):\n",
    "    print(' ' * indent + exception_class.__name__)\n",
    "    for subclass in exception_class.__subclasses__():\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 2)\n",

    "Q3.What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-The ArithmeticError is a built-in class in Python that serves as a base class for exceptions\n",
    "that occur during arithmetic operations. This class is a subclass of the Exception class and a \n",
    "superclass of several other error classes, such as ZeroDivisionError, OverflowError, \n",
    "FloatingPointError, and ValueError.\n",
    "Here are two examples of errors that are defined in the ArithmeticError class:\n",
    "1)ZeroDivisionError: This error occurs when we try to divide a number by zero. For example:\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 0\n",
    "z = x / y  # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "2)OverflowError: This error occurs when we try to perform an arithmetic operation that results\n",
    "in a number that is too large to be represented. For example:\n",
    "x = 2 ** 1000\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "z = x * y  # OverflowError: int too large to convert to float\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.Why LookupError class is used? Explain with an example KeyError and IndexError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-The LookupError class is a built-in class in Python that serves as the base class for\n",
    "exceptions that occur when a key or index is not found in a mapping or sequence. This class is\n",
    "a superclass of several other error classes, such as KeyError and IndexError.\n",
    "Here are two examples of errors that are defined in the LookupError class:\n",
    "1)KeyError: This error occurs when we try to access a non-existent key in a dictionary. For example:\n",
    "d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "print(d['d'])  # KeyError: 'd'\n",
    "2)IndexError: This error occurs when we try to access an index that is out of range in a \n",
    "sequence, such as a list or tuple. For example:\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(a[3])  # IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-ImportError is a built-in exception in Python that is raised when an import statement fails\n",
    "to import a module. This error occurs when Python is unable to locate and load the specified \n",
    "module in the current working directory or in the directories listed in the Python path.\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a Python script example.py that imports the math module:\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(math.pi)\n",
    "2)ModuleNotFoundError is a subclass of ImportError.It is raised when Python is unable to locate\n",
    "the specified module in the current working directory or in any of the directories listed in the\n",
    "Python path.\n",
    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "1)Be specific\n",
    "2)Use multiple except blocks\n",
    "3)Use finally blocks\n",
    "4)Use the with statement\n",
