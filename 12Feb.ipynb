    "'''Q1)What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-In Python, an Exception is a runtime error that occurs when a program encounters a\n",
    "situation that it cannot handle. When an Exception is raised, it means that something \n",
    "unexpected has happened during the execution of the program. Some common examples of Exceptions\n",
    "in Python include:\n",
    "1)TypeError: raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type\n",
    "ValueError: raised when a function argument or parameter has an invalid value\n",
    "NameError: raised when a name (variable, function, module, etc.) is not found in the current \n",
    "scope\n",
    "2)ZeroDivisionError: raised when attempting to divide by zero\n",
    "In contrast, Syntax errors are errors that occur when the Python interpreter is unable to parse\n",
    "and interpret the code due to incorrect syntax. This usually means that there is a mistake in\n",
    "the code that prevents it from being executed. Some common examples of Syntax errors include:\n",
    "Missing parentheses, brackets or quotes\n",
    "Misspelled keywords or variables\n",
    "Improper indentation\n",
    "The main difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors is that Syntax errors are caught by\n",
    "the Python interpreter before the program is executed, while Exceptions occur during runtime \n",
    "and are typically caused by unexpected input or other issues that could not have been \n",
    "anticipated at the time the program was written. Syntax errors are typically easier to fix \n",
    "than Exceptions, since the Python interpreter can often provide helpful error messages that\n",
    "point to the location of the error in the code. Exceptions, on the other hand, require more\n",
    "careful handling and may require more advanced debugging techniques to identify and resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2)What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain withan example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-When an Exception is not handled in Python, it causes the program to terminate abruptly and \n",
    "display an error message or traceback. This can be problematic if the Exception occurs in the\n",
    "middle of an important task or if it is not handled properly, since it can leave the program in\n",
    "an unpredictable or unstable state.\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate what happens when an Exception is not handled:\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    return x/y\n",
    "\n",
    "# This line will raise a ZeroDivisionError if y = 0\n",
    "result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-In Python, the try and except statements are used to catch and handle Exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The try statement is used to enclose the code block that may raise an Exception. If an\n",
    "Exception is raised within the try block, the program will stop executing the try block and \n",
    "jump to the nearest except block that matches the type of the Exception that was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "The except statement is used to define the Exception that the block will handle, along with the\n",
    "code that should be executed in response to the Exception. If the Exception that was raised\n",
    "matches the type of the except block, then the code within the except block will be executed.\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate how to use try and except statements to handle Exceptions:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    y = 10 / x\n",
    "    print(f\"10 divided by {x} is {y}\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: division by zero\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: invalid input\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain with an example\n",
    "1)Try and Else-try and else are two keywords in Python that are used together in exception \n",
    "handling.The try statement is used to enclose the code block that may raise an Exception. If an \n",
    "Exception is raised within the try block, the program will stop executing the try block and\n",
    "jump to the nearest except block that matches the type of the Exception that was raised.\n",
    "On the other hand, the else statement is used in conjunction with try and except blocks to \n",
    "define a block of code that should be executed if no Exception is raised in the try block. \n",
    "The code in the else block will only execute if the try block completes without raising an \n",
    "Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)finally-finally is a keyword in Python that is used in conjunction with a try and except \n",
    "block to define a block of code that should be executed regardless of whether an Exception is\n",
    "raised or not.\n",
    "3)raise-raise is a keyword in Python that is used to explicitly raise an Exception. We can use \n",
    "the raise keyword to raise built-in or custom Exception types in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Ex,eptions? Explain withan \n",
    "example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Custom Exceptions in Python are user-defined Exception classes that allow us to define and\n",
    "raise custom error messages in our code. We use custom Exceptions when we need to raise an \n",
    "error that is not covered by any of the built-in Exceptions in Python.\n",
    "The primary benefit of using custom Exceptions is that they allow us to provide more meaningful\n",
    "and specific error messages to help us debug and understand our code better. Additionally, \n",
    "custom Exceptions can be organized and categorized in a way that makes it easier to identify \n",
    "and handle different types of errors in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to define and use a custom Exception class in Python:\n",
    "class InvalidInputError(Exception):\n",

    "        self.input_value = input_value\n",
