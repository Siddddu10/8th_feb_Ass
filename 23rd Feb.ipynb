    "In pandas, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure that represents tabular data,\n",
    "similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. It is one of the most commonly used data structures in\n",
    "pandas and provides a convenient way to organize, manipulate, and analyze data.\n",
    "A DataFrame consists of rows and columns, where each column can be of a different data type \n",
    "(e.g., numbers, strings, dates). It is like a collection of Series objects, where each Series \n",
    "represents a column of the DataFrame.\n",
    "On the other hand, a Series is a one-dimensional labeled array in pandas. It can be seen as a\n",
    "single column of data from a DataFrame. A DataFrame can be considered as a collection of Series\n",

    "you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "1)head() and tail(): These functions allow you to view the first or last few rows of the \n",
    "DataFrame, respectively. They are useful for quickly inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)info(): It provides a summary of the DataFrame, including the column names, data types, and \n",
    "memory usage. It helps in understanding the structure and characteristics of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)describe(): This function generates descriptive statistics of the numerical columns in the\n",
    "DataFrame, such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. It gives a \n",
    "quick overview of the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)shape: It returns the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the DataFrame. It's useful \n",
    "to check the size of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)columns: This attribute returns the column labels of the DataFrame as a list. It can be \n",
    "helpful to get the names of all the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)loc[] and iloc[]: These indexing functions allow for label-based and integer-based indexing, \n",
    "respectively. They are used to access specific rows and columns in the DataFrame. For example,\n",
    "df.loc[2, 'Name'] will return the value at row 2 and column 'Name'.\n",
    "\n",
    "7)drop(): This function is used to remove rows or columns from the DataFrame. It can be handy\n",
    "when you want to eliminate irrelevant or redundant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)fillna(): It is used to fill missing values in the DataFrame with a specified value or a \n",
    "strategy like mean or median. It helps in handling missing data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "9)groupby(): This function is used for grouping data based on one or more columns. It allows \n",
    "you to perform aggregate operations on the grouped data, such as computing sums, means, or \n",
    "counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "10)sort_values(): It sorts the DataFrame based on one or more columns. You can specify ascending\n",
    "or descending order. Sorting data is often necessary for analysis or visualization purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Which of the following is mutable in nature Series, DataFrame, Panel?\n",
