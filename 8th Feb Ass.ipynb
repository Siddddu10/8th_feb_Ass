    "'''Q1)What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans--1)In Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), Abstraction is the process of hiding the \n",
    "implementation details of a particular feature while displaying only the essential\n",
    "details to the user.\n",
    "2)It allows programmers to create complex systems by breaking them down into \n",
    "smaller, more manageable components.\n",
    "Eg-Thus, we can create an abstract class called \"Car\" that defines the essential \n",
    "features of a car object, as shown below:\n",
    "abstract class Car {\n",
    "  abstract int getCurrentSpeed();\n",
    "  abstract int getNumberOfDoors();\n",
    "  abstract String getFuelType();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class SportsCar extends Car {\n",
    "  int getCurrentSpeed() {\n",
    "    return 200;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  int getNumberOfDoors() {\n",
    "    return 2;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  String getFuelType() {\n",
    "    return \"Gasoline\";\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class ElectricCar extends Car {\n",
    "  int getCurrentSpeed() {\n",
    "    return 150;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  int getNumberOfDoors() {\n",
    "    return 4;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  String getFuelType() {\n",
    "    return \"Electricity\";\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2)Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation.Explain with an example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-1) Abstraction is about focusing on the essential features of an object or \n",
    "system and ignoring the details that are not relevant to the user. \n",
    "For example, in the case of a car object, the essential features that are\n",
    "relevant to the user might include the car's current speed, the number of doors,\n",
    "and the type of fuel it uses. \n",
    "The internal details of how the car's engine works, how the transmission shifts\n",
    "gears, or how the fuel is ignited are not essential details for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can create an abstract class called \"Car\" that defines the essential \n",
    "features of a car object, as shown below:\n",
    "abstract class Car {\n",
    "  abstract int getCurrentSpeed();\n",
    "  abstract int getNumberOfDoors();\n",
    "  abstract String getFuelType();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class SportsCar extends Car {\n",
    "  int getCurrentSpeed() {\n",
    "    return 200;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  int getNumberOfDoors() {\n",
    "    return 2;\n",
    "  }\n",

    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "2)Encapsulation is about protecting an object's internal state and behavior from\n",
    "outside interference. In the case of a car object, the internal state might \n",
    "include the car's current speed, the fuel level, and the engine temperature.\n",
    "These internal states should not be directly accessed or manipulated by code \n",
    "outside the car object. Instead, we can provide public methods that allow \n",
    "external code to access and modify the car's internal state in a controlled \n",
    "manner.\n",
    "class Car {\n",
    "  private int currentSpeed;\n",
    "  private int fuelLevel;\n",

    "Q3-What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-In Python, the abc (Abstract Base Classes) module provides a framework for \n",
    "defining abstract base classes. Abstract base classes are classes that are not \n",
    "meant to be instantiated, but rather serve as a blueprint for other classes to\n",
    "inherit from. They define a set of methods and properties that derived classes \n",
    "must implement in order to be considered \"compatible\" with the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used to create abstract base classes and enforce interface\n",
    "specifications in Python. It provides a way to define abstract methods, which \n",
    "are methods that must be implemented by any concrete subclass. If a subclass\n",
    "does not implement all the abstract methods, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use the abc module to define an abstract base \n",
    "class:\n",
    "\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "        \n",
    "Q4-Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- No, we cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Python. \n",
    "An abstract class is a class that is meant to be subclassed and not instantiated\n",
    "on its own. It is designed to serve as a blueprint for other classes to inherit\n",
    "from, and it defines a set of methods and properties that derived classes must\n",
    "implement in order to be considered \"compatible\" with the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we try to create an instance of an abstract class, Python raises a TypeError \n",
    "at runtime, indicating that we cannot create an instance of an abstract class\n",
